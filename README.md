# CodeRefractor

The website was updated to be more accessible.

The title of the wesbite was changed to make it more related to the webpage and contents.

The images were all given alternative text incase the the images did not load properly.

The css sheet link and image links were properly referenced.

The HTML and CSS files were both noted to breakdown the description of the codes that followed.

The CSS was condensed to include the same stylings/formatting to different elements.

The code was cleaned to the best of my ability and left better than it was found.
